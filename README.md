d## Iem-Scheduler

** Describe Iem-Scheduler here **

This package is a Python Lambda package to use with CDK Pipeline. It doesn't have an API Gateway
definition associated with it. It's most useful when you just want to deploy a lambda function,
perhaps for use as a stream consumer, or invoked by SQS, SNS, or CloudWatch.
